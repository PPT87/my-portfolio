## Software Engineer | Mechanical Engineer

## Background:
Hey everyone! My Name is Peter Tran and i'm a career transitioner from Mechanical Engineering to Software Engineering. I have been working professionally for 8+ as a New Model Project Leader/Supervisor in the automotive industry prior to making my transition. I can surely tell you that i've learned a lot during that time and I know that this switch won't be any different.
